# Passenger Count App

The Passenger Count App is a simple web application designed to help you practice JavaScript while building a useful tool. As your first project in JavaScript, it’s an excellent way to kickstart your coding journey. The app allows users to count and keep track of passengers entering a train, bus, or any other transport system.

## How It Works ??

2. Interactive User Interface: The app has an intuitive interface with buttons for incrementing the count and saving it. The user experience is straightforward and beginner-friendly.
3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You’ve used HTML and CSS to create the layout and styling, and JavaScript to handle the logic behind counting and saving passenger entries.
